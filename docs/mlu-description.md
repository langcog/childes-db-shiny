This analysis shows growth curves for mean length of utterance (MLU), computed in words and overall all utterances in the transcript marked as belonging to a particular speaker. Note that standard CHILDES MLU is often computed over a subset of utterances and using morphemes rather than words. See section 7.22 of the [CLAN manual](http://talkbank.org/manuals/CLAN.pdf) for more details.
